 Hi Basil,=20
 =C2=A0=20
 We=E2=80=99ve been adding to the
 R34 application and now have all functionality implemented.
 We are still waiting for final visual assets from artists
 and modellers, but it would be great if we could arrange a
 time to come and demonstrate the application
  in its current state.=20
 =C2=A0=20
 If you=E2=80=99re available any
 weekday this week, with the exception of Thursday, we=E2=80=99re
 happy to come to the museum to meet with you.=20
