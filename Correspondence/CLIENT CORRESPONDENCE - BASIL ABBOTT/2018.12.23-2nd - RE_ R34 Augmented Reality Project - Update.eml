 Hi Basil,=20
  =C2=A0=20
 As promised, here is a
 link to a YouTube video which shows the current
 application:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DwqsdNNtKSP8&feature=3Dyoutu.be
=20
 The video contains a
 voice-over explaining the on-screen action and
 functionality, as well as how some visual elements will be
 updated in the final version.
 =C2=A0=20
 When final visual
 assets are completed and made available to us, we will keep
 you updated by recording future video demonstrations.
  =C2=A0=20
 If you have any
 questions about the video or project in general, just let us
 know.
  =C2=A0=20
 Thanks,
 Tom, Elliot and
 Henry

 Thanks Basil, these
 images are really helpful.
 Merry Christmas to you

 =C2=A0
 As mentioned yesterday,
 we=E2=80=99ll prepare the recorded demonstration of the
 application which we=E2=80=99ll be able to email through by the
 end of this week - and we=E2=80=99ll be sure to keep you updated
 in the new year as we receive more of the final visual

 Here are the pics you

 need a bath, and one of Jack Pritchard.

 application which we=E2=80=99ll be able to email through by the
 end of this week - and we=E2=80=99ll be sure to keep you updated
 in the new year as we receive more of the final visual
  assets.
