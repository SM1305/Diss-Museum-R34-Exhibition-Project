&nbsp;Hi Basil,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Appreciate the update, the<br>
&nbsp;three of us are excited for the event.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Apologies for the delayed<br>
&nbsp;reply, I=E2=80=99ve been away following the end of the university<br>
&nbsp;semester.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;It would be great if we<br>
&nbsp;could arrange a time to meet with you at the museum to show<br>
&nbsp;what we have produced so far and discuss how we continue<br>
&nbsp;development for the centenary exhibition.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Elliot, Henry and Tom<br>

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Dear Chaps<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Just an update on the R34<br>
&nbsp;project.<br>
&nbsp;I wanted to put on a show<br>
&nbsp;at East Fortune, the starting point of the R34 mission.<br>
&nbsp;But they have declined it,<br>
&nbsp;clobbering years of work.<br>
&nbsp;However, my brother's<br>
&nbsp;drama students at Fife College, Kirkaldy, who were going to<br>
&nbsp;perform, will still do something - possibly a documentary<br>
&nbsp;film.<br>
&nbsp;I have been asked to put<br>
&nbsp;on a Ladies Night in October for the local Freemasons. I am<br>
&nbsp;planning an End of WW1 Commemorative Dinner, with the R34<br>
&nbsp;mission included.<br>
&nbsp;The main events will be on<br>
&nbsp;the centenary weekend, 13th-14th July 2019.<br>
&nbsp;I have got dancers in the<br>
&nbsp;Market Place, on the Saturday morning, with specially<br>
&nbsp;created routines. I hope to have an R34 blimp flying above,<br>
&nbsp;there will be a memorabilia stall, an exhibition already in<br>
&nbsp;the museum, an R34 Treasure Trail for<br>
&nbsp; kids, a schools art exhibition at the back of the church<br>
&nbsp;etc. Maybe we could feature some UOS hands-on work near the<br>
&nbsp;museum that kids could come and have a go at.<br>
&nbsp;In the evening (See:<br>
&nbsp;YouTube Peter Creswell R34) there will be a specially<br>
&nbsp;composed concert in the Corn Hall.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;On the Sunday morning<br>
&nbsp;there will be an R34 service in Diss Church, with readings<br>
&nbsp;from the Log, visuals etc. The Art Group are busy painting<br>
&nbsp;and the Meccano chaps making a model.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;Quilts are being made by<br>
&nbsp;several ladies, and the Spinners, Weavers &amp; Dyers are<br>
&nbsp;making a version of the voyage map.<br>
&nbsp;I am trying to get agents<br>
&nbsp;interested in a radio script of the Log, but no luck yet.<br>
&nbsp;The very local radio station, Park Radio, will feature it, I<br>
&nbsp;am sure.<br>
&nbsp;I have just written to all<br>
&nbsp;the local schools and some in Lothian, Scotland, to try and<br>
&nbsp;get them interested, and am even trying to get some on Long<br>
&nbsp;Island.<br>
&nbsp;I hope all is going well<br>
&nbsp;with your side of the project and will always be pleased to<br>
&nbsp;hear of your progress.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Best wishes<br>
