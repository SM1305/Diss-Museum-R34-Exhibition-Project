Dear Chaps<br>
<br>
Just an update on the R34 project.<br>
I wanted to put on a show at East Fortune, the starting point of the R34 mi=
ssion.<br>
But they have declined it, clobbering years of work.<br>
However, my brother's drama students at Fife College, Kirkaldy, who were go=
ing to perform, will still do something - possibly a documentary film.<br>
I have been asked to put on a Ladies Night in October for the local Freemas=
ons. I am planning an End of WW1 Commemorative Dinner, with the R34 mission=
 included.<br>
The main events will be on the centenary weekend, 13th-14th July 2019.<br>
I have got dancers in the Market Place, on the Saturday morning, with speci=
ally created routines. I hope to have an R34 blimp flying above, there will=
 be a memorabilia stall, an exhibition already in the museum, an R34 Treasu=
re Trail for kids, a schools art
 exhibition at the back of the church etc. Maybe we could feature some UOS =
hands-on work near the museum that kids could come and have a go at.<br>
In the evening (See: YouTube Peter Creswell R34) there will be a specially =
composed concert in the Corn Hall.
<br>
On the Sunday morning there will be an R34 service in Diss Church, with rea=
dings from the Log, visuals etc. The Art Group are busy painting and the Me=
ccano chaps making a model.
<br>
Quilts are being made by several ladies, and the Spinners, Weavers &amp; Dy=
ers are making a version of the voyage map.<br>
I am trying to get agents interested in a radio script of the Log, but no l=
uck yet. The very local radio station, Park Radio, will feature it, I am su=
re.<br>
I have just written to all the local schools and some in Lothian, Scotland,=
 to try and get them interested, and am even trying to get some on Long Isl=
and.<br>
I hope all is going well with your side of the project and will always be p=
leased to hear of your progress.<br>
<br>
